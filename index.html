        <h1> An Unforgettable Book</h1>
        <img src="agoodkindoftrouble-book-productimage.jpeg">
        <h2> My most favorite book yet is "A good kind of trouble" by Lisa Moore Ram√©e. This book mainly focuses on issues about racial stereotypes, first crushes, ethnic identity, and friendships in a carefully structured way for middle-grade students to digest. It is how a 12 year old girl overcomes her fear of standing up for what is right while dealing with school drama.
